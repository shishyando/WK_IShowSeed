# IShowSeed

Seed worshipper. Consistent runs. Set and show seed in all gamemodes, persistent between game restarts. Disables achievements and leaderboards.

### World generation

Things that should stay the same with same seed:
- Levels generation (rooms)
- Props on the ground (like pitons, rebars, etc.)
- Perks & Buffs (temporary and permanent)
- Vending Machines with items have persistent spawn and items
- Enemies spawn

Being tested (may or may not work):
- Roaches
- Turrets
- Barnacle tongues
- events (fog, drone spawns)

Known not-working stuff:
- yet to find out

### UI

- Set and show seed. Press `ctrl + shift + S` at the main menu to set the seed
- View seed ingame via Debug Menu (`F5`)
- Seed shown at the end of the run

### Found a bug? Something is broken?
